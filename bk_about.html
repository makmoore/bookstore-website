            <h2>Our Story</h2> <!-- Story of the bookstore -->
            <p>The Book Nook was founded in 2025 with a simple mission: to create a welcoming space where book 
                lovers can connect, discover new stories, and immerse themselves in the joy of reading. As a 
                locally owned independent bookstore, we take pride in curating a unique selection of books, 
                fostering a love for literature, and supporting our community.<br>
                <br>What started as a small shop with a single bookshelf has now grown into Houston's favorite 
                literary escape, complete with cozy reading nooks, a café serving locally roasted coffee, and a 
                calendar full of engaging literary events.</p>
