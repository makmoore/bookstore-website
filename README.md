## Overview
This project is a practice bookstore website developed as part of an Application Programming course. It provides a simple interface for viewing bookstore information, events, and contact details. The project showcases front-end web development skills using HTML and CSS and was created before learning and implementing JavaScript. Future versions may incorporate JavaScript to enhance interactivity.
